        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I am some random person with too much free time and too little experience. 
            I am a teenager from Switzerland, I like hot chocolate and cats, and I dislike looking at paint dry.
        </p>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a github page that people can use to get information about me.
            Most information here is reliable, unless I haven't updated the website for a while.
        </p>
        <h2>What do I know?</h2>
        <p>
            I know quite a couple of things, a more precise list can be found here: <a href="competences.html">my competences</a>, but in short I am decent with: C#, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Python, and can if necessary figure out how to do something in Rust.
