                <h2>What is the Tomass is Always Right Foundation?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Tomass is Always Right Foundation is an organization founded by Tomass Tribis. It's original purpose was to be a joke, a thing to reference in case he needed to tell someone "I told you so". Slowly, it evolved into a charity, used for two things:
                    tax evasion and making fun of people who do stupid stuff and sending money to them and their family if they get hurt. If you invest today, in the future less people will die of doing stupid stuff. Another thing we at the foundation
                    consider as stupid is cancer, thus a large part of the profits goes to cancer research.

                <h2>Who is Tomass?</h2>
                <p>
                    Tomass is currently the teenager writing this website. He comes from the country of Latvia, known for it's <span class="crossThisOut">alcohol</span> landscape and lack of sane people, but now lives in Switzerland, known for <span class="crossThisOut">being filthy rich</span>                    its landscape, cheese, chocolate and banks. His future plans mostly consist of getting rich, and running for US president (despite having no prior affiliation with the country) and finding love, probably in that order.

                <h2>What does the foundation do to help people?</h2>
                <p>When people do stupid stuff, we send them and their family money, and the amount of it depends on the money you give us. </p>

                    <p>Well, One reason is that he can make text display like a star, which you are witnessing right now, despite not being old enough to get forklift certified. I am now just adding more text to make this more visible Lorem ipsum dolor sit

                        Now, fo some better reasons: its a charity, meaning we give away our money. We at Tomass is Always Right Foundation are honest people, when we get into politics, we don't lie about not lying, we admit that we lie. When Tomass eventually runs for president,
                        expect carnage, and thus if you give us money you will likely be spared

                <h2>How can we be sure this isn't just a waste of our money?</h2>
                <p>
                    You absolutely cannot. But what we can say is that we have helped over 5 people already, and were right about multiple big events, and even are considered to be one of the foundation that are the least likely to fail, due to us not being big enough to
                    be able to fail.

                <h2>What is the Tomass is Always Right Foundation's goal?</h2>
                <p>
                    Its really simple actually:<br> make the world a less bad place.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1vh;">
                    Now think about it. How many problems. how many wars. How many genocides. How many dictators ruling over people. How many democratically elected liars. How many problems, that could have been avoided if people were a little bit smarter? How many problems
                    that are, that if you really look at it, are just stupid? Climate change could have been avoided if humans were smarter and less greedy. The war in Ukraine? Same story. Any war that took any amount of lives? It could have been avoided.
                    But due to humans being stupid, and politicians being greedy, they all happened. Now, we are not claiming that we can fix all issues. No, we cant make it so you can't stub your toe on the table's corner. Nor can we make it so you can't
                    die. Not soon, at least. But if we can nudge humanity in a better direction, won't we be achieving that eventually? With enough people devoted to the goal of making humanity great, we can all achieve so much. We can make stuff necessary
                    to our survival free. We can reduce unnecessary deaths from wars and illnesses.

                <h2>What are some upcoming initiatives or projects our foundation has planned?</h2>
                <p>
                    First, we are planning on using our money to help people who have suffered due to stupidity. Second, we will give a lot of our money to people like the Sarcoma Foundation, to fight against cancer. Next, we are planning to invest into schools all around
                    the world, to give more people access to education, as eduction is the most effective way to fight against stupidity.

                <h2>How is our foundation funded and how is the funding allocated?</h2>
                <p>
                    We are mostly funded through donations, and although that is probably going to change soon, through trading, as it is one of the most efficient ways of getting money on such a scale in this day and age. As for how the funding is allocated, right now,
                    about 50% of our profits are going to people in need, 10% to cancer research, and 40% to education. If we have any money left, its used on advertising and expanding the foundation.

                <h2>What role does technology and innovation play in our foundation's work?</h2>
                <p>
                    It plays an active role, as we take every realistic opportunity to improve the lives of the people, and as we need technology when we get access to it, we try making it more accessible people if it has been proven that the technology does not have any
                    bad side effects. In other terms, we popularize various new technologies.
